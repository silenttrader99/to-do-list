# To-Do List App ✅

Behold, my glorious **To-Do List** app, the classic must-build project for anyone learning React! Now, with added style from Tailwind CSS, this app is ready to help you (or at least pretend to help you) tackle those never-ending tasks. This app is simple, stylish, and 100% overengineered for listing things you may or may not actually complete.

## Features (Yes, It’s Fancy)

- **Add Tasks**: Got something you probably won’t do? Add it to the list!
- **Mark as Done**: Feel that sweet satisfaction of checking off a task (without actually doing it).
- **Delete Tasks**: Clear out your guilt—uh, I mean, completed tasks—with one click.
- **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Because why not make it look snazzy?

## Technologies

- **React**: Because learning React without a to-do app is just unthinkable.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Who needs plain CSS when you can sprinkle utility classes everywhere and feel like a designer?

## Getting Started (You Too Can Experience Task-Listing Bliss)

If you want to get this app running on your local machine, follow these totally normal and definitely-not-too-many steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/silenttrader99/to-do-list.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
    ```bash
   cd to-do-list
3. Install the dependencies
     ```bash
   npm install
4. Start the development server
      ```bash
   npm run dev

## Why I Made This (Other Than Because Everyone Does)
Learning React means building a to-do list app. It’s practically the law. Plus, it turns out keeping track of things you’ll eventually do “later” feels a lot better when you can check them off with stylish buttons.

## Future Enhancements (aka Features I’d Add If I Wasn’t Already Onto My Next Project)
- Animations: Maybe a little “poof” when a task disappears.
- Persistence: Keep tasks saved in local storage, because your tasks are worth it (or maybe they’re not).
- Real-Time Motivation: Popup reminders to actually do the tasks (but only if you’re really feeling brave).
